% An NGP is a nonstationary Gaussian process model that models the
% nonstationary observed real dynamics by employing a local
% parameterizarion across an input space.
%
% NGP term is defined as part of publication of an
% algorithm LISAL that learns NGPs efficiently. NGP is also called iNGP-
% intuitive Nonstationary Gaussian Process. See documentation on lisal for
% more details.

%implemented as part of this code release.
